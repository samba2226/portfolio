Personal Portfolio Website – Project Documentation

 Project Overview
The Styled Portfolio Website is a personal web page designed to showcase my profile, skills, and contact information. The main objective of this project is to apply HTML and CSS fundamentals to build a clean, structured, and responsive website. This project demonstrates my understanding of web layout, styling, and responsive design principles suitable for beginners in web development.
 Setup Instructions
  Follow these steps to run the project locally:
1.	Create a project folder named portfolio
2.	Inside the folder, add the following files:
•	index.html
•	style.css
3.	Create subfolders:
•	images/ → store profile image
•	screenshots/ → store project screenshots
4.	Open index.html in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
5.	Ensure style.css is properly linked in the <head> section
Code Structure
 The project follows a clean and organized file structure:

portfolio/
│
├── index.html	 	(Main HTML file)
├── style.css			(External CSS file)
├── README.md  		(Documentation)
│
├── images/
│   └── resume_photo.png
│
└── screenshots/
    ├── desktop-view.png
    └── mobile-view.png

 HTML uses semantic elements such as <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to improve
 readability and accessibility.
CSS Concepts Used
 The following CSS concepts are implemented in this project:
•	CSS Reset to remove default browser margins and padding
•	Selectors (element, class, and ID selectors)
•	CSS Variables for consistent color scheme
•	Flexbox for header layout and alignment
•	Hover Effects for navigation links and buttons
•	Media Queries for responsive design
•	External Google Fonts for better typography

 Design Decisions
•	A simple color scheme was chosen for readability and professional appearance
•	Flexbox was used to align navigation items efficiently
•	Sections are placed inside cards using padding and border-radius for clean UI
•	Buttons and links include hover effects to enhance user interaction
•	A minimal design approach was followed to keep the layout beginner-friendly
 Responsiveness Approach
    Responsive design is achieved using CSS media queries:
•	Layout adapts for screens below 768px
•	Navigation links stack vertically on smaller devices
•	Font sizes and spacing are adjusted for mobile view
•	Tested using Chrome DevTools mobile simulator
   This ensures the website works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
 Visual Documentation
  Screenshots are included to demonstrate functionality:
•	Desktop View – shows full layout and navigation
•	Mobile View – shows responsive behaviour
 These screenshots are stored in the screenshots/ folder.
Technical Details
•	HTML5 is used for structure
•	CSS3 is used for styling and layout
•	Flexbox handles alignment
•	No JavaScript is used, keeping the project purely HTML & CSS based
•	External CSS improves maintainability and scalability
Testing Evidence
  The project was tested for:
•	Navigation link functionality
•	Form field validation (required inputs)
•	Responsive behaviour across screen sizes
•	Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Edge)
  All components function as expected without errors.
 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the basics of HTML and CSS styling, layout techniques using Flexbox, responsive design, and clean code organization. It serves as a strong foundation for advanced frontend development.
